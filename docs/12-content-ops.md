# 12 · Content operations

The product can only be as right as its ruleset. The design files rank a regulatory content owner as the first hire;
until that person exists, this is the operating model. It is the method the design already publishes: machine
extraction plus acceptance by a person, with thresholds and prescribed terms extracted twice (D-10).

## Roles
| Role | Who | Time |
|---|---|---|
| Extraction engine | Claude Code, using the M2 tools | Batch runs |
| Accepting person | A founder until the content owner is hired | 3–5 hours a week |
| Second key | The content-verifier subagent and the K02 extraction | Every candidate |
| Independent review | A feed-law expert on contract | 3–5 days before the first paid contract, then per release with material changes |

## Weekly rhythm
Monday: source watch (J01) and the extraction batch for the week's targets. Tuesday–Wednesday: the accepting person
works the review queue in /admin. Thursday: fixtures drafted for what was accepted, confirmed by the accepting
person. Friday: release if every fixture passes; the coverage page updates itself.

## Accepting a rule: the checklist
- The excerpt shown is from the stored official text (the sha256 matches `ref.sources`).
- Both extractions agree, or the accepting person resolved the difference against the text.
- Parameters and units are exactly what the text says; the article reference is exact to the paragraph.
- Applicability (species, product class, life stage, market) matches the text, no wider and no narrower.
- Dates: effective_from and any sell-through period are set where the act gives them.
- Fixtures exist for passed, failed and withheld, and pass.

## Coverage honesty
A node × domain becomes `complete` only when every rule the domain needs at launch scope is accepted and tested.
Otherwise it stays `partial` or `not_encoded` with a gap that says plainly what is missing. The public page shows
exactly this table, nothing more.

## Never
- Fetch, store or quote FEDIAF or AAFCO texts (copyrighted). If a rule needs them, record a gap.
- Translate a prescribed term. Every language's term comes from that language's official version of the act.
- Use secondary sources (blogs, consultants' summaries, competitor sites) as a rule source.
- Let anything reach `ref.rule_versions` with status accepted without a person's click.

## Launch scope (D-01)
EU core plus the language layers for Sweden, Denmark, Finland and Germany. Domains: mandatory particulars;
composition and additives (the additive register); prescribed wording and general claims; language; net-quantity
figure height; registration and establishment obligations for the four launch nodes (researched, dated, sourced).

## Candidate targets
`content/candidates/eu-core.yaml` lists the first targets. **Every citation there is a candidate written from
general knowledge: paragraph letters especially must be confirmed against the consolidated text before any
extraction is accepted.** The sources to store first are in `content/sources.yaml`.
